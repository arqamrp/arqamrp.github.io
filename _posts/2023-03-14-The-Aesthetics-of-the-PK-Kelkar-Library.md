The PK Kelkar Library is one of India's most iconic library buildings, and in this essay we're going to unpack what makes it so aesthetically pleasing. 

Not.


The first time someone pointed out the library (on the way back to H13 from a boring Orientation session), I was found it pretty pleasing to look at. This impression, however, was shortlived, as I soon discovered that I was lookiing in the wrong direction. That was the L20 building, and the library was the structure opposite it. I had probably glanced at both buildings and concluded that the large, imposing one would be the library; at any rate the one in front looked too shabby to be the one.

Now before someone comes at me for not being well versed enough with architecture to comment on the issue, a few disclaimers. I readily admit that I don't even possess enough technical knowledge about architecture to call myself a novice, but I have a keen sense of what looks nice (some call it aesthetics). The thoughts expressed here are my subjective opinions, informed by my own taste in aesthetics and architecture. So if you find yourself disagreeing, it may be that you have a more nuanced understanding of architecture and are able to appreciate things that I cannot, or, more plausibly, that you have a horrible (aka different) sense of aesthetics. Or maybe both. Anyways, the Wikipedia page on Brutalism corroborated too many of my criticisms of its design to make me reconsider writing this.

Now I'm certain most people, aesthetics connoiseurs or not, would agree that academic buildings at IITK are gloomy. I'm sure some of it has to do with the fact that academic buildings are associated with, well, academics. Regardless, I'd like to extrapolate this geeral statement about *vibe* to a more specific observation; academic building architecture at IITK is gloomy and soulless (excluding a few new buildings like the aforementioned new lecture hall complex). 

The problem with the PKK library isn't unique. It faces stiff competition for the title of most unappealing building, including from the Faculty Building, whose cute spiral staircase is the only good thing in an otherwise soul-crushing labyrinthine leviathan[^]. This is because these structures were designed according to a common aesthetic style designed by a certain Achyut Kanvinde [^].

This style makes exclusive use of rectangular, functional elements and takes pride in unpretentiousness and simplicity. Indeed, it does appeal to a certain set of people who, probably as an acquired taste, like the architect Le Corbusier, who most Indians would only know by virtue of his 'involvement' with Chandigarh. Since this is not a diss piece on le Corbusier, suffice it to say that I, and many others[^], hold him almost singlehandedly responsible for a lot of the soullessness plaguing the cityscapes of today. 

The problem with describing this architecture is that there's a very short list of adjectives affirming the presence of qualities and a very long list negating those. It is unornamented, unappealing and unremarkable.

it evokes the same emotions evinced by seeing a flayed man, and not just because of the similar colour palette. Adobe and cement, flesh and sinew, are indeed raw and fascinating, but for the aesthetic good health of society best left covered by skin of some different color.

- protruding, 

- Coming from a developing town, the droll, seemingly plasterless cuboidal  exteriors and exposed wall-less columns only remind me of one thing: buildings under construction. Under construction structures, in turn are what I associate with lifelessness, incompleteness and desolation, which I suppose the mass of parked steel beneath the columns does little to allay. 
- Indeed, in an era bygone it could have evoked a sense of awe at the raw figleaflessness (yup I made up this word), the simultaneous modernity and earthiness of the imposing masonry, the sheer scale and  of the civil engineering (thank you mazdoors)
- it probably reflects the zeitgeist well, with its emphasis on production and industry and functionalism inspired in part by the Soviet model, with a yearning towards the new and the modern
- The brutalist element of surprise has just waned away with time, leaving behind the cold resentment and eyesore
- Compared to even the soulless 
- Non-maintenance and neglect, or maybe just the inevitable corrosion by the  and the sands of the eternal hourglass of time, gives the buildings the feel of decaying ruins, replete with the discolouration. I couldn't agree more with the cultural critic who goes by the pen-name Theodore Dalrymple when he speaks of
	... the horrors of Le Corbusierâ€™s favorite material, reinforced concrete, which does not age gracefully but instead crumbles, stains, and decays.
- I have more than a little suspicion that the adoption of brutalism also has something to do with the cost aspect of things.
- While at a closer level the brickwork's earthiness lends some regionality and local flavour, 
- The library's visual as an imposing yet cold, mechanical, heartless colossus makes an impression not dissimilar to the one its namesake makes upon freshers hearing the HR Khadim tale on the airstrip. For the record, I smelt bullshit on day zero and found out PK Kelkar's real daughter's name within a fortnight of the incredulous narration.

- IIT BHU with its semi-modernised temple and rajwada inspired motifs is much better; culturally rooted yet appealing and well kempt
- IIT Delhi and Bombay, however devoid of unique motifs or regional flavour, at least do not exhude dilapidation and despair from their modernist buildings.
