Hi, I'm Arqam, a second-year undergrad at IIT Kanpur, studying Statistics and Data Science (SDS). I'm part of the first batch of this program at IITK, which meant that I had to take a decision based on limited information. In this post, part introspection and part vindication, I try to explore the rationale and intuition behind this decision.


## The Warmup 

The JEE Advance exam was over. The work however, hardly was. The very next day there came the unofficial answer keys, a few days later the official one, and then the revised one. Then finally, after days of impatience, alternating between anticipation and foreboding, came the result.

It turned out I had undercounted my marks in JEE Advanced by ~15. Due to this (and my father's infectious pessimism) I was fully expecting to finalise my enrolment in CSE at BITS Goa (I hoped to get Pilani in a later round). 

I also had a terrible JEE Mains rank, which meant the best IIIT/NIT alternatives were closed to me. I was already regretting not paying enough attention to the application deadlines of the institutes I was eligible for through other quotas: IISc (through my KVPY rank) and IIITH (through the Linguistics Olympiad).

Anyways, when the results came, I was pleasantly surprised. By the grace of God, I'd got an all India rank of 1183. This was worse than what I had in mind before the exam (500-800) but better than what I had forecasted after checking my marks and dsicussing with classmates (1500-2500). My father's estimate, on the other hand, was 3000-4000, based on some random websites and Quora answers. Words can't begin to describe the triumphant feeling of vindication that hid behind my almost stoic face as I announced my rank to my parents.

One final hurdle remained before I could actually let out a sigh of relief: the _multilemma_ of choosing a priority order of programs in the JoSAA counselling process. I had begun researching various programs (mainly rank cutoffs) the day after the exam itself, though it was quite broad since I didn't know my rank yet. I read and watched videos about the different colleges, programs and curricula, about engineering college cultures and the prospective ragging rites that awaited me. 

Now, an obvious and very commonly used metric to gauge demand for a program is its closing rank; the lower, the better. Accordingly, I started my systematic analysis by listing all programs that had a closing rank of until about 1500, along with the number of seats in the open category, the type of degree (BTech/BS/BT-MT), type of branch(CSE/CS-related/circuital/non-circuital), type of institute (top 3, top 5, top 8, top 11) and closing rank.  Then I narrowed my focus down to those in a +/- 250 range of my rank and, according to the criteria I listed, sorted these according to priority. But I didn't just look at the established programs. Through news articles recommended by the Google feed which had recognised me as a _JEEtard_, I got to know about several new programs being launched by different IITs.

The last bit of news was particularly interesting to me. Ideas about stock market investment (value investing in particular) played an influential role in how I perceived the process. So it didn't take me long to deduce that *some* new programs, owing to skepticism over their newness and relative lack of awareness, would be undervalued. 

Accordingly, I initially felt that the new program in Computational Engineering at IITH might be the best choice. But, after corresponding with the professors who were heading the new program, some research about the field, and strong arguments about overspecialisation by my father, I felt it wasn't really *the* hill to die on. 

You see, along with my own process of deliberation, there was another parallel process I had to engage in- convincing and negotiating with my father. While I did have the final say in theory, I had to take inputs from him, accommodate his strongly held views, and convince him what I was doing was rational and optimal. This accommodation mostly took the form of me filling choices I wasn't too enthusiastic about at a higher priority because my father strongly believed those to be better choices and I was confident about *not getting* those. While this constant back and forth was frustrating at times, in hindsight my father's inputs did serve to check my sometimes whimsical and overtly contrarian thinking and forced me to analyse the choices from a different lens.

But anyways, only a couple of days later, I had found *the* hill to die on, again through a news article. I followed up by researching about the program, starting with the [course curriculum](https://www.iitk.ac.in/math/data/Inst_Webpage_STanDS-06-09-21.pdf)  and a YouTube [seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W-nrveF_EY) about the course . I talked to a lot of people; an IITB Mechanical student, an IIT Indore faculty,  a BITS civil engineering graduate, people from my school/coaching at IITK. I read a lot of Quora answers. 

Sidenote; while I was convinced SDS was a better alternative to the established ones, l was in a dilemma between IITG DS&AI and IITK SDS; I found the curriculum of the former more appealing (less theoretical, more applied) and the fact that it was being established under its own department, as opposed to SDS which is under the Maths & Stats department. But there was also the fact that Guwahati was quite far-flung, and IITG not quite as old and established as IITK. In the end, I didn't really have to make a choice since I deduced in the mock rounds that I most probably wouldn't get DS&AI @ IITG.

### The Options
- SDS IITK
- MTH IITK
- MnC IIT KGP
- Mechanical IITB 
- EE IITK
- IIT KGP ECE
- CSE IIT Indore (my father's preference)
- CSE IITGN

I was in one of these rank ranges with a plethora of similar choices (according to conventional wisdom) and no clear winner amongst them. 

Since I had heard about SDS, I was convinced it was going to be the quintessentially undervalued program that would make for an optimal choice.

- The other choices weren't really as appealing
	- I didn't want to go to a new IIT (Hyderabad was an exception because I liked the city)
	- I didn't want to go to Kharagpur or Guwahati since these were too far away
	- I didn't want to stay in Bombay because I felt I'd develop better away from home
	- I knew I couldn't study physics or core engineering for four years
	- I had got an idea about the reputation of the IITK MTH department from Harish and another senior from MTH, Rahul Sethi (my senior at Allen Kohinoor Mumbai as well), which is, to say the least, terrifying. Plus the curriculum seemed too focused on pure, theoretical maths, which didn't exactly align with my goals. 
	- I preferred mathematical-oriented programs to the electrical-oriented ones

The inaccurate valuation of newer programs wasn't the only thing I had borrowed from the stock market investment playbook. I figured that trends in demand (approximated by closing rank) for an established program would be a good quantitative proxy for collective wisdom about its appeal and could also be extrapolated for future movements in closing rank and demand. In simpler words, programs that showed a consistent decline in demand (i.e. rising closing rank) for 4-5 years were likely to decline further, and more importantly, were being judged by intelligent actors as being relatively less attractive than they were in the past. So I made graphs like these to analyse the trend in closing ranks. This was an important factor that made me reconsider my former openness to Electrical Engineering and ECE programs, which consistently showed declines in demand across institutes, which suggested the hivemind was finding these progressively less appealing with respect to other, newer, programs like Mathematics and Computing which were consistently rising.

### Arguments for SDS
- I could have chosen 
- I wanted to study at an old IIT, experience the culture and hopefully benefit from the network
- I was already interested in AI and NLP and this seemed like a related course of study


## Why Not
My father was aginst SDS because
1. It was a new program; in its first year.
2. It was a BS program as opposed to a BTech one.
3. He thought it was excessively specialised and would preclude opportunities in software etc and restrict my scope to data science
4. He was sceptical about the "Statistics" part.
5. He felt that SDS wouldn't be in much demand (ie have a closing rank far lower than my rank) and I was making a suboptimal choice.


## Addressing these
1.  It didn't really matter much; I trusted that IITK was institutionally robust enough to not cause any deficiency on this account 
2. It didn't matter much; the testimonies of Harish and Rahul (along with an alumnus on Quora and a relative who'd done PG at IITB) who themselves were enrolled in BS programs helped convince me while some other accounts lessened my father's apprehensions.  
3. I managed to convince him that tech was a primarily skill based sector and that it wouldn't be a roadblock to a prospective career as a SDE; as exemplified by IITK MTH and EE grads, whose curricula had even less to do with software, being in demand for software roles
4.  "What's in a name?" - Shakespeare
5. I was vindicated in my intuitive belief that it would close below AIR 1500


Anyways, I got SDS in the first round of JoSAA and have never since regretted my choice. IITK is probably the best insti I could have hoped for, with an amazing culture (google "IITK family"), a great deal of extracurricular and career opportunities, helpful seniors, and "chill hai" environment (the weather though is rarely to my liking).

I'm studying with an amazing and talented group of people in SDS, and it's much easier for us to bond within a smaller group like ours. The stats part of the Maths and Stats department faculty has really great professors, with a curriculum that I only modestly hate. Indeed, I think this choice quite aptly reflects my *mizaaj* (for lack of a worthy translation), and my appetite for adventure and rational risks.
